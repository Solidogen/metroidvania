### Metroidvania-like game prototype in Kotlin (KorGE game engine)

Tried to create a 2D platformer game in pure Kotlin with KorGE game engine.

Sadly there are bugs in engine that make it impossible to proceed further.

After changing scenes, some sprites are not cleaned and retain their static bodies, so player can bump into things that were on the previous screen.

To be continued sometime in the future.
